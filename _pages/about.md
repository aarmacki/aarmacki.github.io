I am an All But Dissertation (ABD) PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by prof. [Soummya Kar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~soummyak/index.html). Broadly, my interest lie in signal processing and machine learning. More specifically, I study theoretical guarantees of both centralized and large-scale multi-agent learning systems, in the presence of phenomena such as heavy-tailed noise and statistical heterogeneity between different users' datasets.
 
If you have any questions about my research, feel free to [reach out](mailto:aarmacki@andrew.cmu.edu).
