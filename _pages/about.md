I am a fourth year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by prof. [Soummya Kar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~soummyak/index.html). Broadly, my interest lie in theoretical machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in the learning guarantees of centralized, as well as large-scale distributed systems, both federated and decentralized. Recent projects included establishing learning guarantees in the presence of various notions of heterogeneity, e.g., statistical (non-IID distributions) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10866), or system heterogeneity (varying communication or computation capabilities) [(paper)](https://eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2023/pdfs/0000875.pdf).

If you have any questions about my research, or believe our interests are synergic, feel free to [reach out](mailto:aarmacki@andrew.cmu.edu).
